        content: "Common sense is not merely a slogan; it is the faculty by which we perceive the plain truths of our existence. In the realm of athletics, a plain truth is currently under siege: that biological differences between the sexes matter, and that fairness requires we acknowledge them. \n\nIt has been over fifty years since Title IX was enacted. Its purpose was explicit and noble—to ensure that young women had the same opportunities as young men to compete, to strive, and to achieve glory on the playing field. It was a recognition that without distinct categories, female athletes would be effectively erased from the podium. Today, we face a peculiar regress where the very category of 'girls' sports' is being dismantled in the name of a new, abstract definition of inclusion.\n\nWe are told that to exclude biological males who identify as females from girls' sports is a form of bigotry. But let us apply the lamp of experience. Sports are discriminative by nature. We discriminate by age—we do not force 12-year-olds to wrestle 18-year-olds. We discriminate by weight in boxing and wrestling—we do not pit the featherweight against the heavyweight. We do this not out of malice, but out of a fierce commitment to fairness. Sex is the most fundamental of these biological categories.\n\nWhen a biological male competes in female athletics, the competitive balance is shattered. The bone density, muscle mass, and lung capacity conferred by male puberty provide an insurmountable advantage that no amount of training or 'identification' can erase. To ignore this is to tell every girl on the starting line that her effort, her discipline, and her dreams are secondary to the validation of another's personal identity."

        content: "The New England Patriots have long been defined by a specific culture of accountability and preparation. With the arrival of Drake Maye, that culture faces its most significant test in a generation. Leadership in New England has never been about the loudest voice in the room, but the most prepared one. \n\nAs Maye begins his tenure, we examine why the region's sports identity is so intertwined with the values of grit and resilience. After five years in the wilderness, the rebound of the Patriots is more than just a football story; it's a testament to the idea that actions speak more than words. The region watches not just for wins, but for the restoration of a standard of excellence that defined the 'Patriot Way'."

        content: "In hundreds of small towns across Vermont and New Hampshire, the first Tuesday in March isn't just another day; it's Town Meeting Day. This tradition represents the purest form of direct democracy remaining in the United States. It's a place where a single voice can change the course of a town's budget, and where disagreement is tempered by the fact that you will see your opponent at the grocery store tomorrow. \n\nIn an era of increasing polarization and digital siloization, the physical proximity of the town hall forces a level of civility that is often lost online. Here, civics is not an abstract concept; it is a lived experience of collective responsibility."

        content: "Meldrim Thomson served as Governor of New Hampshire from 1973 to 1979, but his influence is still felt in the state's fierce 'Live Free or Die' attitude. His 'Axe the Tax' mantra was more than a fiscal policy; it was a moral stance on the role of the state. \n\nHe believed that the power to tax was the power to destroy, and that a citizen's liberty was directly proportional to the money they were allowed to keep. Today, as regional tax burdens continue to rise, the Thomson approach remains a focal point for those seeking a more minimalist, less intrusive government in New England."

It means learning the difficult art of productive disagreement and understanding that the preservation of liberty requires an informed and active citizenry."

        excerpt: "Oh my. Congressman John Larson has made “saving Social Security” his banner issue. Only a few highly protective or deeply out-of-touch people think this is a system worth saving...",
        content: "Oh my. Congressman John Larson has made “saving Social Security” his banner issue. Only a few highly protective or deeply out-of-touch people think this is a system worth saving. It should have been ended long ago.\n\nBy 1999 it was clear to anyone that Social Security could not pay its promised returns without a large tax increase. By 2005, Social Security was, by any business definition, bankrupt. Twenty more years of deficits, higher life-expectancies, and a still lower worker-to-payee ratio (now 3:1; when the program was inaugurated it was 18:1), Social Security cannot right itself absent a dramatic cut in benefits, or a tripling of the tax it foists on workers.\n\nThe 1936 system of SS funds being set aside and building interest to be paid decades later lasted all of three years. By 1939, politicians had raided the Social Security Trust. Since then, some or (now) all of its funds go right to the U.S. Treasury, for Congress to spend as it wishes.\n\nSocial Security will always be a fat trove of money for politicians to take. That is because:\n1. Few people notice the mis-directed spending,\n2. Those who notice can’t do anything to stop the politicians or the “Trustees”, and\n3. Those who are hurt most have no political clout: the very young and the unborn.\n\nThe harm to young workers is significant. Social Security (including Medicare), extracts 15.3% of a mid-income worker’s salary. One who “earns” $70,000 a year thus sees only $59,300. Ask one hundred workers whose take-home is $59,300 minus income taxes whether they’d prefer an added $10,700 and forgo a mystical Social Security benefit 20, 30, 40, or 50 years away. At least 90% will say “yes”.\n\nFor those few who would like to entrust their money to the government for those many years (and hope to not die before collecting) there’s a beautiful option that Larson doesn’t countenance: make Social Security optional. The people wanting the government option can still have it; a slimmed-down Social Security system will still give the same percentage returns; it does not require 100,000,000 participants. It doesn’t even require 1,000,000 (see long-standing private wealth managers who do very well for a mere 1000 or so clients.).\n\nLarson is not alone. His blind spot appears to infect every elected Democrat. Not one Democrat has announced a vision other than government-controlled tethering of our earnings. Not one Democrat decries the oppressive unfairness that Social Security foists on younger workers. And ironically, not one elected Democrat even points out that Social Security is the most regressive tax in America. High income earners pay in at a LOWER rate than middle income and low income earners. Currently, the pay-in applies only up to $184,500**. Thus, the person earning above $184,500 annually has a smaller percentage taken out. For the $300,000 earner, the benefit is a boon: 15.3% of $184,500 is just 9.4% of $300,000; for the $750,000 earner, the benefit is laughable: 15.3% of $184,500 is a mere 3.76% of the $750,000.\n\nElected Democrats endorse Social Security because they like government control. The forced pay-in, before even receiving one’s paycheck, is the ultimate way to fund statism. FDR started this morass, and 90 years later, it is a fixture for elected Democrats (and some Republicans).\n\n**Why the Larson solution does not work**\nRep Larson’s main cog in attempted reform is to push for high income earners to pay in at the same rate. If enacted, this would be a very temporary fix. Larson’s solution neglects the pay-OUT aspect of Social Security. At some point, the high earners retire; then their benefits come due and they are HIGHER than the mid-income earner. Larson’s plan might bring a quick infusion of money, but unless the accounting is even more monstrous, the ledger must show a very high expected pay-out for every high paying-in “contributor”.\n\nIndeed, the pay-OUT time almost certainly comes sooner than average if high income earners are fully contributing. At least four reasons gird this:\n1. The highest income earners are on average older and thus closer to withdrawal age.\n2. Because they don’t need the money, they are more likely to take their money out at age 59.5 than the lower income earner who calculates a bigger benefit by delaying withdrawals.\n3. They are healthier, and far less likely to succumb to disease in their early 60s than lower income workers.\n4. They are almost always married, so the Trust Fund will not be keeping their funds, as it does with unmarried workers who die young.\n\nNow, if Larson, in traditional legislative fashion, is just “kicking the can down the road”, with not true fix in sight, that’s even more reason to keep his plans far away from a Congressional vote. If his plan is to fix by taxing workers at a higher rate, that’s from the classic ”tax-because-you-can” playbook.\n\nEither version means Social Security’s purpose is defeated. Social Security was meant to be a backstop, to keep those who had saved inadequately from working until they dropped dead. Now, any attempt to “save” it means a delay of the inevitable collapse, and unfair confiscations along the way. OSDI and Medicare should be optional; if a payout is needed for current retirees and those close to retirement, then that should come from the Treasury, not from workers whose confiscated earnings will never be fairly repaid.\n\n** Social Security was capped for two main reasons: 1) high earners rarely need the benefits in old age, and 2) high earners are influential in policy-making; few legislators felt their well-heeled constituents (including political donors) would brook a 15.3% tax on themselves."
